    \subjobtitle{Software Test Engineer I}{August 2018 - January 2020}
	\jobdescription{
		\begin{itemize} \itemsep -0pt  % reduce space between items
			\item Developed and maintained NLP models and services for Qualtrics's Conversational Analytics team, including backend APIs (Node, AWS, NoSQL), NLP models (HuggingFace, Scikit-Learn, Pytorch), and language libraries (Javascript, Python)
			\item Facillitated end-to-end success of NLP models used for extracting latent information from long-form text (data collection, annotation, modelling, productionization)
			\item Serviced model implementations for broader use cases across Qualtrics and led integration efforts to drive business value
			\item Drove efforts for data-driven integrations of NLP models with Quatlrics' Tickets system to allow customers to derive deeper insights
			\item Mentored and guided multiple interns and peers
		\end{itemize}
	}
	

	%%% Neural Coding Intern, Allen Institute  %%%
	\jobtitle{Neural Coding Intern}{Allen Institute for Brain Science}{June 2017 - August 2017}
	\jobdescription{
		\begin{itemize} \itemsep -0pt  % reduce space between items
			\item Researched and implemented methods for analyzing multi-dimensional signal data gathered by Neuropixels electrodes implanted in live mice under stimulation
			\item Used signal processing techniques to extract features for categorizing brain region (Fourier transform, signal filters, wavelet transforms)
			\item Applied ML algorithms to signal features and labelled datasets to create models for quicker electrode labelling (Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy)
			\item Implemented small-dataset methods to combat the limited amount of training data while limiting overfitting (imblearn)
		\end{itemize}

	%%% Undergraduate Researcher, Brunton Lab %%%
	\jobtitle{Undergraduate Researcher}{Brunton Lab, Universtiy of Washington}{December 2016 - June 2018}
	\jobdescription{
		\begin{itemize} \itemsep -0pt  % reduce space between items
			\item Researched NLP methods on naturalistic, low-quality big datasets to automatically derive labels for further research with electrocorticography data (Python, Shell)
			\item Investigated effects of open-source NLP model architectures being trained on lower-quality data, often half the sampling rate and with significant noise introduced
			\item Curated training set for use with Kaldi, an open source ASR system, and evaluated multiple model iterations trained on that dataset
			\item Read state of the art unsupervized speaker diarization papers and tested findings on the lab's dataset to achieve a 72\% diarization error rate
